This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I started this blog to have my own corner on the Internet to write down my ideas, thoughts, and reflections on readings. 

I do not plan for this blog to become highly popular in some way or another. My hope is that this blog will become a permanent storage for all of my writings and that I will be able to revisit them in the future. 

I intend to host this blog publicly at [zalkar.me](https://zalkar.me/) and also make the source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zalkar-z/zalkar.me) for those who might be interested.
