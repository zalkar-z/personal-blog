This reading is about productivity, awareness of time, and tactics to fight distractions. Straight to the point book written in a simple language - easy to read and apply in real life. Another great reading from Nir Eyal.

- The problem is deeper than tech. We should stop blaming technology for taking our attention away from important tasks. It's about understanding the real reasons why we do things against our best interest. 
- The time you plan to waste is not wasted time. Make sure to allocate time in your schedule for "time wasting" things like checking social media and reading hot headline articles online. If you cannot completely stop doing it, then put it in your schedule and consider as just another task. 
- We get distracted in order to escape discomfort. It is potentially addictive - we keep turning to our phones or anything else that provides a relief instead of doing the actual work and completing the task in front of us.
