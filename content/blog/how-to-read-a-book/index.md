- There is no need to apply all of your reading skills to every reading. Deciding to read to the best of your skills only several books that actually worth it is good enough.

## Inspectional Reading (level 2)

- Step#1: Read the title, the subtitle, the table of contents, preface, intro, index, dust jacket. It will help you to understand which way the wind is blowing. 
- Step#2: If needed, read intros and conclusions of some chapters. Read further if needed. 

## Analytical Reading (level 3)

- Stage#1: Understand book's structure (Rules#1,2,3,4)

### 1. Pigeonholing a Book

**Contents:**

- The Importance of Classifying Books
- What You can Learn from the Title of a Book
- Practical vs. Theoretical Books
- Kinds of Theoretical Books

#### The Importance of Classifying Books

> Rule#1: It is important to classify books. You must know what kind of book you are reading. As early as possible, preferably before you start reading a book.

- The main distinction: Fiction vs Expository (conveying knowledge)
- The first rule mostly applies to Expository work
- In order to follow Rule#1 - do an inspectional reading.

#### What You can Learn from the Title of a Book

- Long story short: title are important, take a moment to think about a title.
- Types of Expository work: (philosophy and history) vs. (science and mathematics).

#### Practical vs. Theoretical Books

- General distinction of all Expository work: Practical vs Theoretical books.
- Practical books tell you what you *should* or *how to* do. 
- Theoretical books mostly state facts
- Practical says: it SHOULD be this way vs. Theoretical says: it IS just this way.
- There is not clear distinction between two categories, some books might be in the overlap of two. 

#### Kinds of Theoretical Books

- Kinds of Theoretical Books: history, science, and philosophy.
- History books tell you a story. The essence of history is narration. History is chronotopic. *Chronos* is the Greek word for time, *topos* the Greek word for place. History is all about events in some places at a particular time. 
- Theoretical scientific books emphasize things that lie outside the scope of average man's normal routine. It might be some kind of edge breaking experiment or a pretty complex proof of some fact. 
- In contrast, theoretical philosophy books refer to the reader's daily life in order to prove a point.


### 2. X-raying a Book

**Contents:**

- Of Plots and Plans: Stating the Unity of a Book
- Mastering the Multiplicity: The Art of Outlining a Book
- The Reciprocal Arts of Reading and Writing
- Discovering the Author's Intentions
- The First Stage of Analytical Reading

**Intro:**

> Rule#2: State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences (a short paragraph).
- Do not be satisfied with just "feeling the unity" that you cannot express. You must be able to apprehend the unity with definiteness.

> Rule#3: Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole.
- Understand the structure of a book. A good book, like a good house, is an orderly arrangment of parts. Each major part has some amount of independence. And each part has a functionality which contributes to the greater structure.
- Great complexity is also a great simplicity. Complex books might be well organized and easy to read.

#### Of Plots and Plans: Stating the Unity of a Book (Rule#2)

- Authors usually state the unity in preface or earlier paragraphs.
- Authors also help to define the unity throughout the book
- Every reader's definition of unity might be different. 


#### Mastering the Multiplicity: The Art of Outlining a Book (Rule#3)

- There is no ideal outline of a book. It depends on what is important for you at the moment.
- Rule#2 and Rule#3 are connected in a way that you have to first understand the structure in order to define the unity of a book.

#### The Reciprocal Arts of Reading and Writing

- Rule#2 and Rule#3 also apply to Writing but in reversed order
- Good authors *cover up* the plain outline of a subject using the rules above in order to make a work of art.
- Good readers should be able to *uncover* the work of art following the same rules (#2 and #3)
- Reading and Writing share common rules and protocols which everyone has to follow in order to do good in either reading or writing. 

#### Discovering the Author's Intentions

> Rule#4: Find out what the author's problems were. The author of a book starts with a question or a set of questions. The book ostensibly (apparently) contains the answer or answers.

- The author may not state the question(s) and answer(s). It is your job as a reader to define them.
- If the author has a set of question, you should try to understand the order of importance they have according to each other.
- Rule#4 might help you with Rule#2 and Rule#3

#### The First Stage of Analytical Reading (Finding structure / what the book is about)

- Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
- State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
- Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
- Define the problem and problems the author is trying to solve
