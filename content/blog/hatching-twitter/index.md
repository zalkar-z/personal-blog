Yahoo! was the first one - offering twelve millions dollars in early days of Twitter, despite the fact that the founders were expecting a hundred million dollar offer. 
- In June 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev visits Twitter HQ and writes his first tweet. Here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRPyVfQTjeY) to a video I found on YouTube.
