**Overview:** This reading is about productivity, awareness of time, and tactics to fight distractions. Straight to the point book written in a simple language - easy to read and apply in real life. Another great reading from Nir Eyal.

#### Master Internal Triggers

- The problem is deeper than tech. A technology should not be blamed for taking away attention from important tasks. It's about understanding the real reasons why we do things against our best interest. 
- "The time you plan to waste is not wasted time" - make sure to allocate time in your schedule for "time wasting" things like checking social media and reading hot headline articles online. 
- We get distracted in order to escape discomfort. What is your discomfort? Pay close attention to your distraction triggers.
- A **technique** I found helpful for dealing with distraction trap is a "ten-minute rule". Everytime you want to check you phone (or any other distraction) - just wait ten minutes before getting distracted. Ideally, you should keep doing your current work and there is a very high chance you would forget about the "urgent" distraction within the next ten minutes.
- Don't be harsh on yourself. Toxic guilt makes us feel even worse leading to another distraction in order to escape the pain of shame. 
- Self-compassion is important - talk to yourself as you talk/support your loved ones.

#### Make Time for Traction

- The Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote this two thousand years ago: "People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time, they are most wasterful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy." Learn to value your time.
- "You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it's distracting you from." When you don't have a plan/schedule, it is difficult to tell the difference between traction and distraction.
- Timeboxing my schedule and giving a limited time to do a specific tasks worked great in my experience.


#### Hack Back External Triggers

- By having your phone in your field of view, your brain must work hard to ignore it, but if your phone isn't easily accessible or visually present, your brain is able to focus on the task at hand. 


#### Prevent Distractions with Pacts

- Effort pact: a kind of precommitment that involvies increasing the amount of effort required to perform an undesirable action. This type of precommitment can help us become indistractable. 
- An effort pact prevents distraction by making unwanted behaviors more difficult to do.
