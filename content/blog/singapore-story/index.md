I have first encountered this book a couple of years ago while still in high school back in Kyrgyzstan. I was very much interested in it, but the task of reading seven hundred pages of pretty sophisticated literature seemed too ambitious back then. I did read very few books until my 20th birthday. Apparently, I haven't developed a habit of reading and enjoying books back in early childhood and even throughout all levels of school, all the way before college. To be precise, I have finished three of four books up until the summer of 2019. 

It was the middle of summer 2019 when I started enjoying books more than before. I like reading about business, technology, productivity, and political history. I started this virtual bookshelf to keep track of my reading/wish lists and potentially to reflect on some of my readings. I would love to come back and analyze how my reading habits and preferences have changed over the years. 

**This is the first notes and highlights of my virtual bookshelf. Hurray!**
