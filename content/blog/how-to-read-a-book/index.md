## Part#2 - Analytical Reading (The Third Level of Reading)

> Rule#1: It is important to classify books. You must know what kind of book you are reading. As early as possible, preferably before you start reading a book.

The main distinction: Fiction vs Expository (conveying knowledge)

Types of Expository work: philosophy, science, and mathematics. 

General distinction of all Expository work: Practical vs Theoretical books. Practical books tell you what you *should* or *how to* do. 

Kinds of Theoretical Books: history, science, and philosophy.

History books tell you a story. The essence of history is narration. History is chronotopic. *Chronos* is the Greek word for time, *topos* the Greek word for place. History is all about events in some places at a particular time. 

Theoretical scientific books emphasize things that lie outside the scope of average man's normal routine. It might be some kind of edge breaking experiment or a pretty complex proof of some fact. 

In contrast, theoretical philosophy books refer to the reader's daily life in order to prove a point.
