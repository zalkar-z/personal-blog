- There is no need to apply all of your reading skills to every reading. Deciding to read to the best of your skills only several books that actually worth it is good enough.

## Inspectional Reading (level 2)

- Step#1: Read the title, the subtitle, the table of contents, preface, intro, index, dust jacket. It will help you to understand which way the wind is blowing. 
- Step#2: If needed, read intros and conclusions of some chapters. Read further if needed. 

## Analytical Reading (level 3)

**Three stages:**

- Stage#1: Understand what the book is about and find out its structure (Rules#1,2,3,4)
- Stage#2: Interpret book's content (Rules#5, 6, 7, 8)
- Stage#3: Criticizing a book as a communication of knowledge

**Notes:**

- The arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric cooperate in regulaing the elaborate processes of writing and reading. 
- Skill in the first two stages of analytical reading comes from a mastery of grammar and logic. Skill in the third stage depends on the art of rhetoric.
- While the first two stages of analytical reading can be done in any order or even combined together. The third stage of analytical reading has to be done after the first two. Every reader must make sure to understand the book before critizing.

### 1. Pigeonholing a Book

**Contents:**

- The Importance of Classifying Books
- What You can Learn from the Title of a Book
- Practical vs. Theoretical Books
- Kinds of Theoretical Books

#### The Importance of Classifying Books

> Rule#1: It is important to classify books. You must know what kind of book you are reading. As early as possible, preferably before you start reading a book.

- The main distinction: Fiction vs Expository (conveying knowledge)
- The first rule mostly applies to Expository work
- In order to follow Rule#1 - do an inspectional reading.

#### What You can Learn from the Title of a Book

- Long story short: title are important, take a moment to think about a title.
- Types of Expository work: (philosophy and history) vs. (science and mathematics).

#### Practical vs. Theoretical Books

- General distinction of all Expository work: Practical vs Theoretical books.
- Practical books tell you what you *should* or *how to* do. 
- Theoretical books mostly state facts
- Practical says: it SHOULD be this way vs. Theoretical says: it IS just this way.
- There is not clear distinction between two categories, some books might be in the overlap of two. 

#### Kinds of Theoretical Books

- Kinds of Theoretical Books: history, science, and philosophy.
- History books tell you a story. The essence of history is narration. History is chronotopic. *Chronos* is the Greek word for time, *topos* the Greek word for place. History is all about events in some places at a particular time. 
- Theoretical scientific books emphasize things that lie outside the scope of average man's normal routine. It might be some kind of edge breaking experiment or a pretty complex proof of some fact. 
- In contrast, theoretical philosophy books refer to the reader's daily life in order to prove a point.

### 2. X-raying a Book

**Contents:**

- Of Plots and Plans: Stating the Unity of a Book
- Mastering the Multiplicity: The Art of Outlining a Book
- The Reciprocal Arts of Reading and Writing
- Discovering the Author's Intentions
- The First Stage of Analytical Reading

**Intro:**

> Rule#2: State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences (a short paragraph).
- Do not be satisfied with just "feeling the unity" that you cannot express. You must be able to apprehend the unity with definiteness.

> Rule#3: Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole.
- Understand the structure of a book. A good book, like a good house, is an orderly arrangment of parts. Each major part has some amount of independence. And each part has a functionality which contributes to the greater structure.
- Great complexity is also a great simplicity. Complex books might be well organized and easy to read.

#### Of Plots and Plans: Stating the Unity of a Book (Rule#2)

- Authors usually state the unity in preface or earlier paragraphs.
- Authors also help to define the unity throughout the book
- Every reader's definition of unity might be different. 


#### Mastering the Multiplicity: The Art of Outlining a Book (Rule#3)

- There is no ideal outline of a book. It depends on what is important for you at the moment.
- Rule#2 and Rule#3 are connected in a way that you have to first understand the structure in order to define the unity of a book.

#### The Reciprocal Arts of Reading and Writing

- Rule#2 and Rule#3 also apply to Writing but in reversed order
- Good authors *cover up* the plain outline of a subject using the rules above in order to make a work of art.
- Good readers should be able to *uncover* the work of art following the same rules (#2 and #3)
- Reading and Writing share common rules and protocols which everyone has to follow in order to do good in either reading or writing. 

#### Discovering the Author's Intentions

> Rule#4: Find out what the author's problems were. The author of a book starts with a question or a set of questions. The book ostensibly (apparently) contains the answer or answers.

- The author may not state the question(s) and answer(s). It is your job as a reader to define them.
- If the author has a set of question, you should try to understand the order of importance they have according to each other.
- Rule#4 might help you with Rule#2 and Rule#3

#### The First Stage of Analytical Reading

Goal: Finding structure / what the book is about

- Rule#1: Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
- Rule#2: State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
- Rule#3: Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
- Rule#4: Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve


### 3. Coming to Terms with an Author

**Contents:**

- Words vs. Terms
- Finding the Key Words
- Technical Words and Special Vocabularies
- Finding the Meanings

#### Words vs. Terms

- One word can be the vehicle for *many terms*, and one term can be expressed by *many words*
- Term = a word used unambiguously
- Term = a skilled use of words for the sake of communicating knowledge
- This chapter exclusively applies to **expository** books. Poetry and fiction aren't that much concerned about conveying specific knowledge through terms

> Rule#5: Find the important words and through them come to terms with the author

- Notice that the rule#5 above has two parts. The first part is to locate the important words, the words that make a difference. The second part is to determine the meaning of these words, as used, with precision
- These steps are important in order to truly understand an author. If language was a pure and perfect medium for thought, if each word was an ideal term. There would be no need for interpretation, you would be able to see straight through the writer's words to the content of their mind. Interpretation would be unnecessary.
- Because language is imperfect as a medium for conveying knowledge, it also functions as an obstacle to communication. The rules of **interpretive reading** are directed to overcoming that obstacle. 

#### Finding the Key Words

- Not all words are important. Most words are used in an ordinary way and should not trouble you as a reader.
- The most important words are those *that give you trouble*. If you fail to come to terms with the author on these words, you have work to do here. It is likely that these words are important for the author as well.
- Other common ways to spot a key word is if the author used a different styling for the words, emphasized it several times, or explicitly defining it. 

#### Technical Words and Special Vocabularies

- Technical words are of high important in order to understand a fairly complicated subject.
- You can spot them *positively* through having some acquaintance with the field, or *negatively* by knowing what words must be technical, because they are unfamiliar to you.
- Philosophers are notorious for having private vocabularies and adding new words. These can be spotted in a similar fashion as the technical words.
- If you are reading a book to increase your understanding, to learn a new subject, it stands for a reason that not all words will be completely intelligible to you. You must pay enough attention to words to locate their difficulties. The reader who fails to ponder, or at least to mark, the words that he does not understand is headed for disaster. 

> Most of us are addicted to non-active reading. The outstanding fault of non-active or undemanding reader is his inattention to words, and his consequent failure to come to term with the author. 

#### Finding the Meanings

- Once you have spotted the key words, you have completed the first part of Rule#5. The next step (second part of Rule#5) if to find their meanings. 
- How does one find out what the meanings are? The answer is that *you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of all the other words in the context that you understand*. This must be the way, no matter how merry-go-roundish it may seem at first. 
- Finding the meanings is not an easy job, but it is not impossible. Patience and practice.

#### 4. Determining an Author's Message

**Contents:**

- Sentences vs. Propositions
- Finding the Key Sentences
- Finding the Propositions
- Finding the Arguments
- Finding the Solutions
- The Second Stage of Analytical Reading

#### Sentences vs. Propositions

- A proposition in a book is also a declaration. It is an expression of author's judgment about something. He affirms somethings he thinks to be true, or denies something he judges to be false. He asserts this or that to be a fact.
- Sentences vs. Propositions is similar to Words vs. Terms
- Sentences and paragraphs are grammatical units. They are units of language. Propositions and arguments are logical units, or units of thought and knowledge.

> Rule#6: Mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the propositions they contain

> Rule#7: Locate or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding them in the connection of sentences

- Both Rule#6 and #7 apply primarily to expository works.

#### Finding the Key Sentences (Rule#6 - 1/2)

- From your point of view as a reader, the sentences important *for you* are those that require an effort of interpretation because, at first sight, they are not perfectly intelligible. You understand them just well enough to know there is more to understand. They are the sentences that yu read much more slowly and carefully than the rest.
- Finding key sentences might help you to find the key words, and vice versa. Terms constitute propositions. Propositions contain terms. If you know the terms the words express, you have caught the proposition in the sentence. If you understand the proposition conveyed by a sentence, you have arrived at the terms also.

#### Finding the Propositions (Rule#6 - 2/2)

- You discover propositions by interpreting all the words that make up the sentence, and especially its principal words.
- Try to read and understand the surrounding sentences in order to get a better context to understand the sentence of your interest.
- Complicated sentences usually express more than one proposition. It takes time and practice in order to learn to break them down properly. 
- Try stating the sentence in your own words. If you are able to communicate the same proposition with somewhat different set of words, then you probably found the propositon the author is trying to make. 

#### Finding the Arguments (Rule#7)

- Argument - a sequence of propositions, some of which give reasons for another. An arguments may be expressed in a single complicated sentence. Or it may expressed in a number of sentences that are only part of one paragraph. Sometimes an argument runs through several or many paragraphs. 

> Another furmulation of Rule#7: Find if you can the paragraphs in a book that state its important arguments; but if the arguments are not thus expressed, your task is to construct them, by taking a sentence from this paragraph, and one from that, until you have gathered together the sequence of sentences that state the propositions that compose the argument.

#### Finding the Solutions (Rule#8)

- These three rules of analytical reading–about terms, propositions, and arguments-can be brought to a head in an eight rule, which governs the last step in the interpretation of a book's content. More than that, it ties together the first state of analytical reading (outlining the structure) and the second stage (interpreting the contents). 

> Rule#8: Find out what the author's solutions are

- In Rule#4 you tried to understand the author's problems and questions. Here, you try to find the answers and solutions to those. Most authors would provide the answers/solutions they found, so it does not require much effort from the reader. 

#### The Second Stage of Analytical Reading

Goal: Finding out what a book says (interpreting its contents)

- Rule#5: Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.
- Rule#6: Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.
- Rule#7: Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
- Rule#8: Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; ans as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.

> Progress check! If you made it here and understood the eight rules of analytical reading-you have come a long way. More than that, you are now able to complete your analytical reading of the book. The third and the last stage of the job will be relatively easy. You have been keeping your eyes and your mind open and your mouth shut. Up to this point, you have been following the author. From this point on, you are going to have a chance to argue with the author and express yourself.

#### 5. Criticizing a book fairly (Critical Reading)

**Contents:**

- Teachability as a Virtue
- The Role of Rhetoric
- The Importance of Suspending Judgment
- The Importance of Avoiding Contentiousness
- On the Resolution of Disagreements

**Intro:**

- The activity of reading does not stop with the work of understanding what a book says. It *must be completed by the work of criticism, the work of judging.* 

#### Teachability as a Virtue

- A person is wrongly thought to be teachable if he is passive and pliable. On the contrary, teachability is an extremely active virtue. No one is really teachable who does not freely exercise his power of independent judgment. He can be trained, perhaps, but not taught. *The most teachable reader is, therefore, the most critical*. 

#### The Role of Rhetoric

- Rhetoric is involved in every communication that takes place among human beings. In the context of criticizing a book, rhetoric is a skill of knowing how to react to anyone who tries to convince or persuade us. 

#### The Importance of Suspending Judgment

> Rule#9: You must be able to say, with reasonable certainty, "I understand", before you can say any one of the following things: "I agree" or "I disagree" or "I suspend judgment". These three remarks exhaust all the critical positions you can take.

- Suspending judgment is important if you have not finished reading the book entirely. Even so, you might still have some work to do in the first two phases of nalytical reading before you can state your judgment.

#### The Importance of Avoiding Contentiousness

> Rule#10: When you disagree, do so reasonably, and not disputatiously or contentiously. There is no point in winning an argument if you know or suspect you are wrong.

- As a reader, you *should be as prepared to agree as to disagree*. You win only by gaining knowledge, not by winning the argument with the teacher (author) (alive or dead). 

#### On the Resolution of Disagreements

> Rule#11: Respect the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by giving reasons for any critical judgment you make.

- Opinion = unsupported judgment 
- Knowledge = opinion that can be defended


#### 6. Agreeing or Disagreeing with an Author

**Contents:**

- Prejudice and Judgment
- Judging the Author's Soundness
- Judging the Author's Completeness
- The Third Stage of Analytical Reading

**Intro:**

- If for the Rule#9 you said, "I don't understand" and you think that the fault is with the book rather than you - you should be able to support your argument that the book is unintelligible by pointing out the sources of trouble.
- On the other side, if you said, "I understand" and you agree with the author - the work of analytical reading is complete done.

#### Prejudice and Judgment

- In case you said, "I understand but Disagree," you can make the following remarks to the author: (1) "You are uninformed"; (2) "You are misinformed"; (3) "You are illogical - your reasoning is not cogent"; (4) "Your analysis is incomplete".

#### The Third Stage of Analytical Reading

A. General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette

- Rule#9: Complete the task of understanding before judging.
- Rule#10: Do not be disputatious or contentious in your judgment.
- Rule#11: Support your opinions by giving reasons for any critical judgment you make.

B. Special Criteria for Points of Criticism

- Rule#12: Show wherein the author is uninformed.
- Rule#13: Show wherein the author is misinformed.
- Rule#14: Show wherein the author is illogical.
- Rule#15: Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incomplete.

#### 7. Aids to Reading

**Contents:**

- The Role of Relevant Experience
- Other Books as Extrinsic Aids to Reading
- How to Use Commentaries and Abstracts
- How to Use Reference Books
- How to Use a Dictionary
- How to Use an Encyclopedia

**Intro:**

- *Extrincis* aid to reading is any aid to reading that lies outside the book being read.
- *Intrinsic* reading is reading a book on its own without any external resources involved.
- So far we have intentionally focused on *intrinsic* reading only in order to learn as much as we can on our own. But it would be wrong to ignore *extrincis* aids to reading. Extrinsic aid can help. And sometimes they are necessary for full understanding. 
- Do your best before jumping to extrincis aids. There is always more you can understand on your own and you will find that you need less and less outside help.
- There is no specific order of use for the extrinsic aids listed below. 

#### The Role of Relevant Experience

- Common experience might help you to understand philosophy books
- Special experience might help you to udnerstand scientific books and history. 

#### Other Books as Extrinsic Aids to Reading

- Some books might be related to each other (earlier versions) - make sure to read such books in the right order to improve your understanding.

#### How to Use Commentaries and Abstracts

- Use commentaries, abstracts, and plot digests wisely, which is to say sparingly. Never read any of these before reading the book itself completely. 
- Commentaries, abstracts, and plot digests might be useful in understanding some parts of a book. However, it is easy to get into the habit of depending on those too much, which will make you a worse reading in a long run.
- Commentaries, abstracts, and plot digests might be a good tool to remember the books you have already read.

#### How to Use Reference Books

- There are many kinds of reference books. Here we will confine outselves mainly to the two most used kinds, dictionaries and encyclopedias. 
- To make reference books efficient for your reading, you must know what you are looking for and you must be able to ask a specific question. Reference books are useless to people who know nothing.
