**Notes:**

### The Importance of Classifying Books

> Rule#1: It is important to classify books. You must know what kind of book you are reading. As early as possible, preferably before you start reading a book.

- The main distinction: Fiction vs Expository (conveying knowledge)
- The first rule mostly applies to Expository work
- In order to follow Rule#1 - do an inspectional reading.

### What You can Learn from the Title of a Book

- Long story short: title are important, take a moment to think about a title.
- Types of Expository work: (philosophy and history) vs. (science and mathematics).

### Practical vs. Theoretical Books

- General distinction of all Expository work: Practical vs Theoretical books.
- Practical books tell you what you *should* or *how to* do. 
- Theoretical books mostly state facts
- Practical says: it SHOULD be this way vs. Theoretical says: it IS just this way.
- There is not clear distinction between two categories, some books might be in the overlap of two. 

### Kinds of Theoretical Books

- Kinds of Theoretical Books: history, science, and philosophy.
- History books tell you a story. The essence of history is narration. History is chronotopic. *Chronos* is the Greek word for time, *topos* the Greek word for place. History is all about events in some places at a particular time. 
- Theoretical scientific books emphasize things that lie outside the scope of average man's normal routine. It might be some kind of edge breaking experiment or a pretty complex proof of some fact. 
- In contrast, theoretical philosophy books refer to the reader's daily life in order to prove a point.
